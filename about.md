I'm a cybersecurity guy trying to pose as a hackerman. I started this blog because I am (self-proclaimed) terrible when 
it comes to organization. Hopefully, through doing writeups, that skill develops over time. I truly enjoy all things nerd: programming,
malware analysis, forensics, etc.

When going through my writeups, the implied first step of any machine is to kick off some [lo-fi beats](https://youtu.be/bebuiaSKtU4).

Outside of HackTheBox, I'm a husband, dad, soccer coach, and a nearly finished college student.

I hope you enjoy the writeups. If they're trash, I've purposefully left off a comments section.

#### Keep trying.
